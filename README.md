The program prompts the user to input an infix expression, checks for balanced parentheses, and displays an error 
if they are not balanced, prompting the user to enter a new expression. If the parentheses are balanced, the program converts the infix expression
to a postfix expression and displays it, followed by evaluating the expression and printing the result. To exit the application, the user can type 'quit' and press enter.
